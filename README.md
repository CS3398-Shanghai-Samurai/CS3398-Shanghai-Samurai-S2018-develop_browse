  - The GUI for the website came together as planned. There is still some tweaking to do, but the prototype of the website is functional       and # follows the design. This branch contains some HTML files which derive the pages of the site.

  - NEXT UP: Tweak the aesthetic attributes of the interface to be more appealing and pleasing to use while maintaining its utility. We       will # use the website as a model for developing the mobile app.
